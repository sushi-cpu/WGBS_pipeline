Bismark report for: pseudo_sample2_R1.trimmed.fastq.gz and pseudo_sample2_R2.trimmed.fastq.gz (version: v0.24.2)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /Users/sushant/Desktop/Github/nextflow_wgbs/genome/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	97587
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	2142
Mapping efficiency:	2.2% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	94349
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	1096
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	1076	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	1066	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
